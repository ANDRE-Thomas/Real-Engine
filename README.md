# Real Engine
A C++ / OpenGL Rendering Engine

Real Engine is a side project I've been working on in which I try to create a simple game engine in C++ using OpenGL. I also use a variety of libraries like <a href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> and <a href="https://github.com/assimp/assimp">ASSIMP</a>, my goal being to learn as much as I can and not to re-invent the wheel for everything.

## Usage

Real Engine is not meant to be used for any serious game development, you can take the code and use it as a learning resource if you want.
